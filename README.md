ESP8266 Based WiFi Connectivity monitor. This Script Ping For Google Public DNS and report the ping time on Attached I2C display. If there is any connectivity issue display it and blink LCD backlight if it's enabled
* Script is dirty. And you need ESP8266Ping, ESP8266WiFi, LiquidCrystal_PCF8574 and Wire Libraries to work. 

Future Work 
-----------
Add an Photo Resister to analog pin and detect Background Light level to decide backlight blinking based on that input because backlight brightness cannot be controlled
